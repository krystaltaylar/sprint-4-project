# Vehicle Price Analysis Tool
This project is a Random Event Simulation Tool used designed to model and visualize various random scenarios using Python. It was built to explore the relationships between vechile fuels types, transmission types, odometer readings, and prices. One part of the analysis focuses specifically on vechicles with automatic transmissions and fuel type including gas, electric, and hyrbid.  The other part of the analysis focuses on odometer readings and fuel types. The project provides insights into price distributions and trends.
